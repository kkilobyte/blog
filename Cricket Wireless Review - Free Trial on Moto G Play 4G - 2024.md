# Cricket Wireless Review - Free Trial on Moto G Play 4G - 2024
<sub>From a Spectrum Mobile and TracFone user</sub>
# Who is Cricket and what are they offering?
Cricket is an MVNO of AT&T, fully owned by AT&T. They offer way cheaper prices such as US$25 per month for an unlimited service with 3 GB of highspeed data, they also have a free trial tier that lasts 2-weeks with a new number with that same 3GB plan, however it is slightly more deprioritized than normal Cricket lines and obviously direct AT&T users and AT&T Business users, along with your data being shut off if you use all 3 GB of your data. They just need an e-mail address, a phone number, and a home address, and they will send you a phsyical SIM kit.
# Device Info
For this, I am using a Cricket branded Motorola Moto G Play 4G - 2024, that is still locked and unactivated. It has a Snapdragon 680 4G chipset with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of UFS storage. I decided I will use this device over my unlocked Samsung Galaxy A32 5G (T-Mobile (U TMB) converted to Unlocked (U1 XAA) - MTK Dimensity 720) and my unlocked Samsung Galaxy A03s 4G (TracFone (S134DL TFV) - MTK Helio G35) because the Moto is Cricket branded (so less issues) and I felt like Snapdragons have better Modems.
# Obtaining the SIM and activating it
I just normally went to the Play Store and downloaded the tryCricket app, opened it, I used my G-mail address and my Spectrum phone number along with my house address and it came within a few days. I popped out my unactivated Cricket SIM and replaced it with the trial SIM, opened the app, let it activate, when all of my bars disappeared I turned on Airplane mode, rebooted, turned off Airplane mode, turned off Wi-Fi, and tada!! 4G LTE with all bars on Cricket.
# Speeds and 4G limitation
Obviously my Motorola handset is not a 5G device so I won't be able to go to the full extent of what it could offer, although it does get similar speeds to my GSM TracFone flip phone (Alcatel MyFlip 2 - Snapdragon 210) which is also a 4G-only handset, while my 5G handset (Motorola Moto G Power 5G - 2023 - MTK Dimensity 930) gets way better speeds (on a way better carrier tho (Verizon MVNO (Spectrum)).
I would say it maxes out at around 20 Mbps where I live, which is impressive because TracFone GSM (with a worse modem tho) gets around 10 Mbps average and I heard AT&T is worse than T-Mobile in more suburban and urban areas
# Comparison with other carriers/devices
The following is a list of devices that I compared terms of speed at my house: 
_** - Moto G Play 4G - 2024 / Cricket Wireless 3GB Trial (free) / 7 Mbps Down & 8 Mbps Up / Ookla Speedtest (Play Store) / Qualcomm Snapdragon 680**_
 - Moto G Power 5G - 2023 / Spectrum Mobile Unlimited ($25/mo) / 178 Mbps Down & 10 Mbps Up / Ookla Speedtest (Play Store) / MediaTek Dimensity 930
 - Alcatel MyFlip 2 / TracFone GSM 180/180/180 ($20/tri-mo) / 6 Mbps Down & 2 Mbps Up / Network Test (KaiStore) / Qualcomm Snapdragon 210
# Signal
I have no complaints with signal. I have not lost signal at all until I tried [switching phones](#free-trial-woes)
# Phone number quality
No complaints with the number I got, no one is calling me for a Diana (Spectrum) or a Melissa (Google Voice) or a Annie (TracFone), of course this is entirely luck based so you may not get so lucky. I would avoid telling people this number is permanent, and keep your old number running, I do not know if you can keep the number when the trial ends if you buy a phone plan or anything, so I would not risk it.
# Free Trial Woes
So there are a few things I noticed that will end your trial prematurely. One is switching phones, I went from a Moto 4G to a Samsung 5G trying to do two reviews with 4G and 5G, but my service just stopped working and calling people, texting people, or accessing data, and after a few moments after switching back to the Moto, I get a notification saying I'm out of data (its a 3GB plan and I used 374 MB), and pressing it takes me to a website that says my account is rather suspended (for fucking what?), or I used up all my data (374 MB <<<< 3 GB), or that my phone isn't compatibile, but it has FUCKING Cricket BRANDING and it was working BEFORE. This is fucking bullshit.
# Conclusion
The Free Trial is pretty decent, but AVOID at ALL costs if you want to switch devices or play around in the app. It will kill your service and support says you have to buy a new SIM. Why do you have to buy a new damn SIM card for a free service and if its a BYOD service! What fucking bullshit.
