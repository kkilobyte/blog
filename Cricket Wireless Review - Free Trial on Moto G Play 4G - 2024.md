# Cricket Wireless Review - Free Trial on Moto G Play 4G - 2024
<sub>From a Spectrum Mobile and TracFone user</sub>
# Who is Cricket and what are they offering?
Cricket is an MVNO of AT&T, fully owned by AT&T. They offer way cheaper prices such as US$25 per month for an unlimited service with 3 GB of highspeed data, they also have a free trial tier that lasts 2-weeks with a new number with that same 3GB plan, however it is slightly more deprioritized than normal Cricket lines and obviously direct AT&T users and AT&T Business users, along with your data being shut off if you use all 3 GB of your data. They just need an e-mail address, a phone number, and a home address, and they will send you a phsyical SIM kit.
# Device Info
For this, I am using a Cricket branded Motorola Moto G Play 4G - 2024, that is still locked and unactivated. It has a Snapdragon 680 4G chipset with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of UFS storage. I decided I will use this device over my unlocked Samsung Galaxy A32 5G (T-Mobile (U TMB) converted to Unlocked (U1 XAA) - MTK Dimensity 720) and my unlocked Samsung Galaxy A03s 4G (TracFone (S134DL TFV) - MTK Helio G35) because the Moto is Cricket branded (so less issues) and I felt like Snapdragons have better Modems.
# Obtaining the SIM and activating it
I just normally went to the Play Store and downloaded the tryCricket app, opened it, I used my G-mail address and my Spectrum phone number along with my house address and it came within a few days. I popped out my unactivated Cricket SIM and replaced it with the trial SIM, opened the app, let it activate, when all of my bars disappeared I turned on Airplane mode, rebooted, turned off Airplane mode, turned off Wi-Fi, and tada!! 4G LTE with all bars on Cricket. Obviously my Motorola handset is not a 5G device so I won't be able to go to the full extent of what it could offer, although it does get similar speeds to my GSM TracFone flip phone (Alcatel MyFlip 2 - Snapdragon 210) which is also a 4G-only handset, while my 5G handset (Motorola Moto G Power 5G - 2023 - MTK Dimensity 930) gets way better speeds (on a way better carrier tho (Verizon MVNO (Spectrum)).
