# KaiOS review - Alcatel MyFlip 2 on TracFone
<sub>from an Android user</sub>
## What is KaiOS?
So basically, KaiOS is an OS made to revive FirefoxOS, an OS that uses Android HAL (and ultimately Linux) to power low end smartphones with specs from both 2012 and 2016 and then making those smartphones "dumbphones" by giving it a Blackberry-like QWERTY, Nokia-like barphone, or Motorola-like flip phone chassis. It's a little ironic because FirefoxOS was designed for smartphones with a smartphone chassis such as the Alcatel One Touch Fire (although the specs are way worse than 90% of the KaiOS devices). (Not to be confused with Amazon's Fire phone.)
## Device info
My unit is the Alcatel MyFlip 2 (flip phone), which is the TracFone varient of the Alcatel Go Flip 3, with the added SOS button above the outside screen with the added benefit of being debug-enabled (so I can use WebIDE to sideload some apps like Discord). It has 4 GB of RAM- wait no not RAM, it has 4 GB of eMMC storage, which will be a pain- maybe. It also has 512 MB of RAM which is also really low, along with the Snapdragon 210. It's comparable to both my Huawei Fusion 2 (512MB + 4GB) and ZTE Avid Plus (Snapdragon 210) in specs, both are Android handsets from 2012 and 2016 respectively. It runs KaiOS 2.5.4, meaning I get the KaiStore, a newer theme, and I would assume a newer version of Firefox 
## Obtaining the device and activating it
Getting the device was easy, I just needed like $25 in cash, grabbed an Alcatel handset, went to the counter, and bought it. I used the handset as a Wi-Fi device for a while before getting another $25 in cash for a TracFone AirTime card (basic phone plan - 3 month - 180/180/180) and then later grabbed the second Alcatel handset just for fun. Activating the device was simple. Since the pharmacy seemed small I assumed the cameras only lasted for a week so I turned on a VPN on my Android phone, turned off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and sensors, went to the TracFone website, and activated it as normal (with fake details). Funny enough, TracFone gives 1000 reward points (which can be used for perks) everytime you activate an AirTime card, I used those extra points to get myself 3 extra GB of cell.
## First glance
KaiOS seems really locked down at first glance, and because MyFlip 2 seems similar to the debug-locked Go Flip 3, I thought my unit was debug-locked, but after inputting the debug code (*#*#DEBUG*#*# or *#*#33284*#*#) it gave me both ADB and WebIDE access. Without sideloading, it seems pretty simple and locked down still, with a limited number of apps (despite everything being a Firefox webview), and some apps actually like WhatsApp are being removed from KaiOS which is ironic. 
## Sideloading and KaiStore Apps
There wasn't a Discord app and there isn't a TikTok app on the KaiStore, neither is there Hulu, but with sideloading I got Sveltecord (aka Cyan-2048's Discord4KaiOS) and there is a TikTok app on BHackers that I still need to sideload. The designed way to sideload is using a Linux computer and using the KaiOS RunTime, but nothing is stopping you from using a Windows or Mac computer and using an old Firefox version (or Waterfox classic) and using WebIDE. I used Waterfox Classic's WebIDE on Windows 10 and KaiOSRT on Debian 12 mostly. Sadly, unlike Android (with APKs) or iOS (with TrollStore with IPAs), you can't sideload without a computer on here. Wallace Toolbox's "Install App Package" doesn't do anything, CrossTweak says "Method Outdated", and KaiRoot also does nothing. 
As per KaiStore rules, you MUST implement KaiAds, meaning the phone is going to just be FULL of ads, if I wanted ads I would buy a damn Fire phone (not to be confused with FirefoxOS). In all fairness, this is a $20 phone with another $20 for 3 months of service (you need 2 months to unlock so that's like $13), so altogether it's like $33/40. Now I am willing to accept the fact that everything I do is just going to be full of ads, but what kinda pisses me off is that KaiOS Technologies takes over **70%** of all revenue that KaiAds makes on your app. That is PAINFUL. There was a game dev who said the revenue from KaiAds isn't even enough to cover the cost of a server, which leads people to just host their app on BHackers, but as previously mentioned, a good amount of Kai phones are debug-locked, requiring root patches to the /boot partition to get debug, which is just sad honestly.
## Rooting
On BananaHacker's Google Site, it's told that you are supposed to use the ADBroot app or the telnetd or Wallace apps to obtain root, but none of them actually work and seem to only work on some random Nokia model, not my Snapdragon Alcatel. I've tried doing things inside ADB shell to try and obtain root, but nothing actually works and it was all a waste of time. I don't really need to root or obtain custom firmware as KaiOS 2.5.4 with sideloading is good enough for me. In theory there isn't any downsides to rooting other than killing the device unlike on iOS and Android where apps can check the device integrity and see if it's modified in any way and then crash. I would assume apps wouldn't need to as it's all just a Firefox webview.
## Signal and speed
The signal actually isn't that bad despite there being like a decade old modem in here. It actually gets better signal than my Moto G Power 5G (2023) on Spectrum Mobile in some areas, meaning when I'm at school, my Moto will get no signal or weak signal while this Alcatel will get weak or mediocre signal (my school *PROBABLY* has cell blockers). However despite living in a suburban city in California, it gets at most like 20/5 Mbps on cellular, and the same goes for the Wi-Fi (it's 2.4 GHz only Wi-Fi - makes sense since the SoC is from like 2015). I get as low as 5/2 Mbps on both Wi-Fi and cellular, I don't feel as TracFone is to blame as the speeds are identical (my Spectrum Wi-Fi maxes out at like 450/15 Mbps). My Moto with a way newer modem and SoC (MediaTek Dimensity 920) gets as low as 0.5 Mbps and as high as 750/20 Mbps.
## T9 keyboard
The keyboard on my second unit felt nice, however the keyboard on my first unit didn't feel so nice. I swapped the motherboards as the first unit was a little beat up and that's the activated one anyways. One felt more mushy while the other felt more tactile. It's weird but even the more mushy one doesn't feel that bad anyways. The predictive isn't that bad, but I hate how you can't wipe the dictionary/previous words and it pushes those previous words HEAVILY over normal words, like I don't want to say "VeggieTales" when I am trying to put "The" in my message. Sometimes when doing normal non-predictive T9 typing, it's a little annoying when I have to wait for the cursor to reset in any word that has two letters nearby, however something I learned to do is to press 0/Space and then backspace. I dislike the lack of a dedicated home button, and instead you have to hold the Backspace/Back/Decline/Power key for a couple seconds to go home. On my Orbic Journey V (Android flip phone) and my friend's Samsung SGH-A157 (2012 Java flip phone) you can just press the decline key to go home. 
## Software experience
The home screen is ok. I dislike the lack of non-Util and non-Game folders and how the app has to be programmed to go into those Util/Games folders instead of letting the user decide. I dislike how you can't change what apps are on the left side dock, I don't use KaiStore or Maps enough to keep them there and I would rather have Discord and Messages. I also dislike how Maps and Youtube and Assistant isn't in the app drawer, which is odd. All three of those apps show up in KaiStore and settings but not the app drawer. KaiOS is EXTREMELY optimized for this 512 MB system. There are 256 MB KaiOS devices which does make sense for why this phone feels snappy (sometimes,, and at times I forget this thing only has 512 MB of RAM and a 2015 Snapdragon, however some things, like waiting for apps to load, reminds me of the immense powerhouse this thing has, or well at least compared to 1950 tech. For some reason you can't have custom notification noises (not to be confused with call ringtones), but using the CrossTweak app, I am able to set my notification tone to "Pixie Dust" and have it at max volume just for shits and giggles, and in settings the notify tone shows up as "Unnamed" I do wish this thing had a newer browser version, RCS, 6-digit passcode or letter password support, but you can't have everything. 
## Updates
The update path is HORRIBLE. Most phones don't even recieve any OTA updates! Both of my Alcatel handsets got ONE single OTA update, and all it did was fix networking (which was needed, everything but updates worked) and update the icons. It didn't give me a new KaiOS version nor a newer Browser version, it just stayed on the same KaiOS 2.5.4. In hindsight it might be for the best as I heard KaiOS 3.x implemented more anti-user design with disabling sideloading (what??? that can't be right) and removing custom tones (that doesn't even make sense) along with making the YouTube app just a browser shortcut, but I feel like the new browser version would help with many broken websites.
## Hardware
As previously mentioned, it's got weak specs. It has the Snapdragon 210 SoC, 512 MB of RAM, and 4 GB of eMMC. It has a 1,350 mAh battery, a 2.8 inch internal display at 240x320 (primary) and 1.44 inch external display at 128x128 (secondary). The display is extremely crummy but it's not bad for just basic calls and texts and even the basic games like Tetris, but for YouTube and web browsing it's not that good at all, however it does make it good for just a side thing since the display is small so you can multitask and pay less attention to the phone. I've personally done that. 
## Web browsing
My handsets are on KaiOS 2.5.4, meaning many things are outdated, no Kaicord, no new browser version, just and older Firefox version. One major broken website I found annoying especially when searching things up was Reddit. I'm not no degenerate Reddit scroller, but if you have been on the internet for more than a week and have been searching things up and trying to fix issues, especially with Kai phones, you have been on Reddit once or twice. Thankfully, a workaround was clicking on a Reddit link, pressing the RSK key, pressing search, and replacing "www.reddit.com" with "old.reddit.com". It's not pretty, but it's at the very least functional. For some reason, clicking on a YouTube link from within the browser doesn't open the YouTube app like if you did from the dock, which would be fine, if the YouTube website instead of the browser was slower than the YouTube "app" and lacked some things like automatic fullscreen, which confuses me. Aren't both supposed to just be the website? Isn't the YouTube app just supposed to be the same as YouTube in the browser without any overlays? 
## Google Maps
Location doesn't work. It asks me to allow location, and then I do, and then it asks again saying I have to enable geolocation, like you should've already done that, I need geolocation for Maps. After I enable it it just says "getting location" "still getting location" forever and ever. It's not worth a damn getting that to work at all. However, if you don't feel like getting location to work, or just don't want to enable it, you can press on Directions, input a destination, input your location, hit Go, and then it will tell you step by step directions, and you just have to press Next (RSK) or Previous (LSK), but that is going to be annoying as fuck if you are driving, but you can always just have a passenger giving you directions I guess. There is no voice output so it is definitely useless as a driver. Due to the fact GMaps doesn't have functional geolocation, just keep that shit off, it is under the Network & Connectivity category in Settings.
